# postmarketOS on Samsung T110 Goyawifi

## Project description

The project aims to bring postmarketOS, an Alpine Linux based distro, to the Samsung T110 Goyawifi, specifically the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7.0 model. postmarketOS is a mobile Linux operating system designed for longevity and open development, focusing on bringing mainline Linux to various devices.

This model of tablet is stuck with Android 4.2.2, and due to the fact there's some necesary binaries and property code to build a newer version of Android, running the postmarketOS is a viable alternative to extend the usage life of this device.
